Results are rather disappointing, and I don't know exactly what I can do to
drastically improve results.  Things that I can try.

1) Redo datastore to tabularTextDatastore, in order not to lose resolution.  
2) Add dropout layer to compensate for unbalanced data.
3) In case of rare events, autoencoders might do!
