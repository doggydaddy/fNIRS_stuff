fNIRS analysis code for myrto and erik

Over the years, a lot of code about fNIRS analysis has been made. This is a
place for current, and older, code. The code (and some analysis results) are
divided into their subfolders according to their purpose, time of initial
writing, and general for whom the code was (originally) written. 

fnirs_txt2nii_afni: perform 1st lvl (and code for some group level analysis)
using afni. Converts merged txt files into nii and then use afni to perform
glm.

myrto_feardisgust: old group level analysis code (notebooks) for myrtos 1st
paper.

spm_fnirs_convert: scripts (matlab mostly) to convert our data into spm_fnirs
compatible format.

ttestToTemplate: Code to convert group level analysis results to surface (for
presentation purposes mostly).
